Post 1 - First Meeting

My class is just beginning. At our first official meeting, we discussed the idea of test-driven development. I received some reading materials and some tasks.

My upcoming tasks include coming up with some learning outcomes for the course, as we don't have a full list yet, as well as creating a github for a Java serialization task.

I'm looking forward to what comes next.
