This week was a skip week. Dr. Bowring cancelled for personal reasons. I had prepared some of the learning outcomes for the course:

Understand the difference between Acceptance and Developer TDD
Be able to describe the order of TDD processes - i.e. is code added before tests or vice versa
What frameworks/tools are used for TDD?
Understand how TDD aids documentation
Problems with TDD: i.e. tests don't reveal bugs, but it does catch them, etc.
Know the relationship between productivity and quality with software development.
Know the ways to think about testing as cumulative goals.
Know the theoretical barriers to complete testing
Know the pesticide paradox and complexity barrier and their implications for testing
Know the difference between testing and debugging
Know the types of testing

I sent them to Dr. Bowring for review. 

I also created a GitHub and created the Serialization and Deserialization classes. Dr. Bowring corrected this implementation over email. This will be discussed in the next blog post.
