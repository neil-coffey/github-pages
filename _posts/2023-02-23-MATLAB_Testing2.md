This was a short week as we just met on Saturday this past week.

For this week, I added some of the resource files and created a new branch. Dr. Bowring instructed me to begin maintaining a resource folder that the testing files can pull from, instead of having all of the files in the same directory as the code.

I managed to make it to where these files can get imported instead of the ones in the code folder, and I expanded and updated these files to their (presumably) final versions. In reality, these versions aren't final, as there are some errors in my MATLAB code that are taking a bit to long to identify.
