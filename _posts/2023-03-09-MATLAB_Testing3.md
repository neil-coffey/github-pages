My errors from the previous week are still giving me trouble. 

Leaving the errors aside, my developments this week include adding the rounding function to the MatLab.java file. This rounding function, provided by Dr. Bowring, uses BigDecimal to perform math and round large numbers properly and precisely. I was able to add this to the previously implemented tests and was able to verify the decimal/rounding point of about 7 functions for the MatLab.java file.

I fear that in the future some of these functions may turn out to have fewer sigfigs than originally thought, but that problem will be easily detected since these are unit tests and since a single sigfig or perhaps 2 will not impact the output of any function in any significant way, especially in cases were the number of sigfigs is already 8 or 12.
