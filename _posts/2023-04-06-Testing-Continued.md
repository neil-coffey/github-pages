This week I continued testing. 

I finished up the implemenatation of rDivide and created a linspace2. For this week Dr. Bowring helped me through a pull request to merge these changes with the original code. 

Although before this I had already contributed tests, it feels good to know that some of my tests were useful in identifying errors and that these changes are reaching the original repository.
