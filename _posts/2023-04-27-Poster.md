For this week I worked on a poster and worked on wrapping up some of the tests. I found out how to test SplineBasisModel and was working on testing it but nothing seemed to be working.

I ultimatley found that there is potentially an error in the spline basis model function. There is a transposition of the input in the function prior to some of the caluclations, leading the final output to be flipped. After dicussing this with Dr. Bowring and considering the usage of this function in the real code, we decided to leave further investigations of this output as a TODO.

Regardless, the output is still correct, just transposed, so as long as the implementation/usage is aware of this there should be no issues currently.
